    <p>Dont judge me. I know most of you will judge me regardless.</p>
    <p>Why do I start with that? simple. It's because i'm a pet freak;if that;s a thing;</p>
    <p>Anyway i'm kidding...haha. I love dogs. I happen to own a couple of them but my favorite of them all happens to be my dear dog Kanye</p>
    <p>Its a German shepherd and sadly I do not have any pictures of that Godly creature with me here so I guess you might not agree with me when I tell you of how good he is</p>
    <p>But you know what i'm goin to do?...i'm going to attach a picture of a sweet elephant i came by online (dont mind me, im that silly). ENJOY!</p>
